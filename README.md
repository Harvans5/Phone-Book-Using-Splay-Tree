Splay Tree Project - Simulates a phone book that stores a person's full name and their phone number. Each person's information 
is a node that is stored in a splay tree, a type of self adjusting binary search tree, that adjusts its nodes to mantain an 
amortized run time of O(log(n)) for operations such as deletion and searching for nodes, by making a new node or searched for node the root of the tree, or when deleting rotating the desired node to the root before deletion, still maintaing the usual binary search tree traits while preforming these operations.
