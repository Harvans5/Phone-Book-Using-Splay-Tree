Projects utilizing data structures and operating system techniques

Splay Tree Project - Simulates a phone book that stores a person's full name and their phone number. Each person's information 
is a node that is stored in a splay tree, a type of self adjusting binary search tree, that adjusts its nodes to mantain an 
amortized run time of O(log(n)) for operations such as deletion and searching for nodes, by making the new node the root of the 
tree.
