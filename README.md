# Phone Book
Splay Tree Project - Simulates a phone book that stores a person's full name and their phone number. Each person's information 
is a node that is stored in the splay tree, a type of self adjusting binary search tree, that adjusts its nodes to mantain an 
amortized run time of O(log(n)) for the majority of its operations.
